As soon as the device&#39;s LED is starting to blink orange while showing &quot;RES&quot;, release the main button and press and hold it again until the device&#39;s LED is lighting up green. The device will then restart into the calibration process and look for a Zigbee network to join. In case something went wrong, the device&#39;s LED will start to blink red.
